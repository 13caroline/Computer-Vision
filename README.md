## Tutorial 1

The present work was based on the development of functions capable of applying **Low Pass filters** to images, either in the spatial domain or in the frequency domain, as well as implementing the **Canny method** for _edge detection_. ([Technical report](https://github.com/13caroline/Computer_Vision/blob/master/Tutorial_1_Grupo6/Tutorial1_VC_Grupo6.pdf))

## Tutorial 2

The present work was based on the development of functions capable of _segmenting images_, regardless of the existence of non-uniform lighting, occlusion or other types of problems, as well as the detection of coins through the **Hough transform**. ([Technical report](https://github.com/13caroline/Computer_Vision/blob/master/MEI_Computer_Vision_tutorial_2_A80874_A80142/MEI_Computer_Vision_tutorial_2_A80874_A80142.pdf))
